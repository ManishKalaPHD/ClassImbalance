Pseudo code for SMOTE 

SMOTE(A, N, m)

Input variables: 
A: number of avalanche days samples
N: amount of SMOTEd samples
m: number of neighbours to be considered for each avalanche day

Intermediate variables: 
num_param: number of parameters
matrix_smoted: matrix for storing new synthetically generated samples
matrix_avalanche: matrix of avalanche days samples
nn_array: array for ‘m’ nearest neighbours of each avalanche day class sample

BEGIN

While desired imbalance ratio not achieved
For i = 1:A
    Calculate ‘m’ nearest neighbours of ith avalanche class instance and store their indices in    
    nn_array;
    	    For smote_idx = 1:N
        random_idx = a random index between 1 and m;
        For j = 1: num_param
            random_gap = a random number in [0,1];
          euc_dist = matrix_avalanche (nn_array(random_idx),j) – matrix_avalanche (i,j);
          matrix_smoted(smote_idx,j )= matrix_avalanche (i,j) + random_gap * 		            euc_dist;
