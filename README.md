## Features  

- **Pseudo-code:**  
  Step-by-step instructions to understand the algorithmic logic behind SMOTE and KMeansSMOTE.  

- **Python Implementations:**  
  Python scripts implementing both techniques with clear, modular code for easy integration into your projects.

## Installation  

Clone the repository to your local system:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManishKalaPHD/ClassImbalance.git
cd ClassImbalance
```

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage  

### Pseudo-code  
The **`Pseudocode/`** folder contains the algorithmic steps for SMOTE and KMeansSMOTE. You can refer to these files for a high-level understanding of the techniques:  
- `SMOTE.txt`  
- `KMeansSMOTE.txt`

### Python Code  
The **`PythonCode/`** folder contains Python scripts:  
1. **SMOTE Implementation:**  
   Run the SMOTE script to generate synthetic samples for your imbalanced dataset.  
   ```bash
   python PythonCode/SMOTE.py
   ```

2. **KMeansSMOTE Implementation:**  
   Run the KMeansSMOTE script for clustering-based oversampling.  
   ```bash
   python PythonCode/KMeansSMOTE.py
   ```

## About the Techniques  

1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):**  
   SMOTE works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class using interpolation between nearest neighbors in feature space.  

2. **KMeansSMOTE:**  
   A variation of SMOTE that applies kMeans clustering before generating synthetic samples, ensuring better distribution of synthetic samples and reducing overfitting.
